  // 2. The proxy peer in a region is always backed by a database i.e a peer
  //    that acts as a witness (of raft log) cannot be a proxy peer.
  // 3. A region can have no valid proxy peers, in which case the leader ships
  //    ops directly to all peers in that region.
  // 4. peers that get proxied through an intermediate (proxy) peer should
  //    not be backed by a database.
  // 5. Leader ships ops to all peers in its own region i.e no proxying in
  //    leader's region.
